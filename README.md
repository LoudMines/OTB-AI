# final project team 50 luit
This version has 4 player types:
1. ConsolePlayer, which allows the user to input moves in text format in the console
2. SpeechPlayer, which allows the user to play moves using peech recognition
3. MiniMaxPlayer, which plays using the minimax algorithm
4. Player, which plays using random moves. 

If you want to change which are playing each other, edit his in __init__ of game_loop.py
by default it is set to console versus minimax.
